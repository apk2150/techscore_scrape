#### This script gets roster size of each school for a given season from [Tech Score](https://scores.collegesailing.org/) and writes it to a csv file. 

To change the season change the value of SEASON to whatever season you want to look at. Seasons are deontated by s for spring or f for fall followed by the last two didgits of the year. (For example "s23" for Spring 2023)
